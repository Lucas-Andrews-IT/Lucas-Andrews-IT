👋🏻 Hi, my name is Lucas

🎓 Soon to be graduate with a CCNA and Certificate IV in Computer Networking. (Dec 2022)

🌇Sydney Native, with a passion for creating content and developing skills that will grow with the Information Technology industry.

📚 From a young age, I was always tinkering and playing with technology such as old computers and testing their capabilities and what I could do with a computer system. Presently, I am building and developing a HomeLab with Proxmox to host local services and a Discord Bot Application that I started programming and designing in 2021 June. It has had its challenges for me, but I have always persisted and overcome the hurdles of this personal project. I'm currently attempting to prepare for my Certified Cisco Network Associate and Comptia A+/Network+/Security+ examinations for pursing a professional career in computer networking.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as System Administrator role and work with a diverse team that specialized in handling the foundations of technological needs in an ICT Environment.

💪🏽 My areas of expertise are: Hardware Installation, Operating System/Software Installation and Configuration, Programming, Scripting, Database Design/Management, Server Installation and Configuration, Medium-level Software Development in Python, Subnetting, Technical Documentation, Technical Support, Technical Troubleshooting, Diagramming, Version Control, Proficient in Windows 7/8.1/10/11 and Linux Debian/Manjaro.

🏔 In my free time, I like to try new experiences so you will either find me trying and learning new foods/cultures, video games, and traveling to new places.
